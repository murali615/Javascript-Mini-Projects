let bookPrice=499;
const bookDiscount=20; //we cant change value in entire program
var TotalAmount;
console.log(`With Discount the TotalAmount of Book is ${bookPrice-((bookPrice*bookDiscount)/100)}`) 
/* var TotalAmount=50;
var TotalAmount=60;
console.log(TotalAmount+TotalAmount) 
here iam taking same named variables using same var keyword So when we use this way it will take last updated value and previous values are deleted So that why the ouput is 120*/
